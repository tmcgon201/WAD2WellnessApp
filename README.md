# WAD2WellnessApp
This is a website that has been crated for the practical assessment for Web Application Development 2. This coursework utilises templating and the MVC architecture.

# Coursework specification
You are tasked with developing a web application which will enable users to find information about
wellbeing and set themselves goals to help enhance their sense of wellbeing.

The application should allow the users to do the following:
  * Anyone should be able to browse to the site and view an About Us page with information about
    the application
  * Individuals should be able to register for the application
  * Registered users should be able to login and
  * view information about nutrition, fitness and a healthy lifestyle
  * define a series of personal goals in each category (nutrition, fitness, healthy lifestyle)
  * add, remove and modify their own personal goals for several weeks ahead
  * record the achievement of their own personal goals when they occur. e.g. goals can be
    ticked off or actual times or number of repetitions can be recorded
  * review a history of their own personal achievements

# Deployed version of the website
The website can be found at:
